# BunDLe-Net
Behavioural and Dynamic Learning Network (BunDLe Net) is an algorithm to learn meaningful coarse-grained representations from time-series data. It maps high-dimensional data to low-dimensional space while preserving both dynamical and behavioural information. It has been applied, but is not limited to neuronal manifold learning. 

After creating a new virtual environment, to install dependencies, you can run
'''
python3 -m pip install requirements.txt
